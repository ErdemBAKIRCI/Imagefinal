## Project Description
This repository contains the solution for the UYG332 Image Processing Final Project. The tasks are implemented using Python and OpenCV in a single Jupyter Notebook.

## Repository Contents
- `UYG332_Final_Project_Solution.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook file containing solutions to all 6 problems.

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib scipy
```

2. Place all images in a folder named `imagefinal` in the same directory as the notebook.

3. Run the notebook:
   - Use Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to open and execute all cells.

## Required Libraries
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy (for Gaussian filtering and Fourier transforms)

## Notes
- All problems are solved using only the provided dataset.
- The notebook contains Markdown explanations and visual outputs for each step.
- No AI-based or external libraries were used beyond what was discussed in class.
